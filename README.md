## Usage

#### Gradle

Add dependency in your build.gradle

```groovy
implementation 'com.cuneytayyildiz:consent-sdk-helper:1.0.0'
```

<b>The constructor has 6 parameters, first 3 of them are mandatory.</b>
```kotlin
 class ConsentSDKHelper(
 private val context: Context, // An activity or application context
 private val publisherId: String, // Publisher ID from AdMob, Go to AdMob -> Left Menu -> Settings -> Under the Account information section
 private val privacyPolicyURL: String, // Privacy Policy URL for your app
 private val admobTestDeviceId: String = "", // Check the logcat to get a test device id 
 private var DEBUG: Boolean = false, // You can use BuildConfig.DEBUG to test consent dialog
 private var isEEA: Boolean = false // To check how consent library acts if user within EU region or not.
 )
```

#### Implementation

```kotlin
val consentSDK = ConsentSDKHelper(this, publisherId, policyURL, admobTestDeviceId, BuildConfig.DEBUG)
        consentSDK.checkConsent(object : ConsentCallback {
            override fun onResult(isRequestLocationInEeaOrUnknown: Boolean) {
                if (isRequestLocationInEeaOrUnknown) {
                    Log.e("ConsentSDKHelper", "User is from EU region")

                    labelTextView.text = getString(R.string.user_within_eea_text, getPersonalizedOrNotSuffix(ConsentSDKHelper.isUserLocationWithinEea(this@MainActivity)))

                    consentSDK.requestConsent(object : ConsentStatusCallback {
                        override fun onResult(isRequestLocationInEeaOrUnknown: Boolean, isConsentPersonalized: Boolean) {
                            labelTextView.text = getString(R.string.user_within_eea_text, getPersonalizedOrNotSuffix(isConsentPersonalized))
                        }
                    })
                } else {
                    Log.e("ConsentSDKHelper", "User is not from EU region")
                    container.removeView(buttonChangeConsentSettings)
                }
            }
        })

```

#### To generate ad requests

After you have implemented this library, you should use ConsentSDKHelper.getAdRequest function to create new ad requests. 
The function has 3 parameters including 2 optionals to get test ads.
```kotlin
ConsentSDKHelper.getAdRequest(
context: Context, 
isDebug: Boolean = false, // To get test ads BuildConfig.DEBUG can be used.
admobTestDeviceId: String = "" // Check the logcat to get a test device id 
):
```
 
```kotlin
    // load a banner ad
    adView.loadAd(ConsentSDKHelper.getAdRequest(context));
    // load a Interstitial ad
    interstitialAd.loadAd(ConsentSDKHelper.getAdRequest(context));
```

#### Change or revoke consent
There is also a preference, to allow users to update their consent just like the Google App. 

I have translated all the languages spoken in European Region, all pull requests are welcome to make translations clear.:heart:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <com.cuneytayyildiz.android.consent.sdk.helper.preference.ConsentSDKHelperPreference android:key="preference_ad_choice" />

</PreferenceScreen>
```
